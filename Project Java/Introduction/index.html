                        The Simplex Algorithm is a is a mathematical optimization refers to a set of methods
                        widely used to solve linear programming problems.
                        In this case this Algorithm was codify on Java. <br>

                    <h2>Mathematical Model</h2>
                    <p>
                        Is one of the types of scientific model models that employs
                        some type of mathematical formulation to express relationships and proposition. 
                        In this Algorithm en the option two you enter you Mathematical Model. <br>
                        First: <br>
                            You must enter how many rows and columns has your table. <br>
                        Second: <br>
                            In the option three you'll be able to see how your board looks like. <br>

                    <p>
                        In the option 4: <br>
                        Here you enter you Mathematical Model in Its Standard Form this means that you must
                        you enter Mathematical Model but before you enter you solition you have to enter the value of 
                        S1, S2, ... , Sn after you enter you solution. <br>
                        Then you enter you fuction Z but this will be at the end after entering all your variables. <br>
                        In the option 5: <br>
                        In the option three you'll be able to see how your board looks like. <br>   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the option 6: <br>
                            In this option the Algorithm search the value most negative of the last row 
                            which belongs to the function Z, the Algorithm show you what is the value 
                            most negative and the column where it is located. <br>
                        In the option 7:<br>
                            In this option the corresponding operations will be 
                            performed between the input column and the last column.<br>
                        Finally: <br>
                            Repeat these steps to get to the solution.
